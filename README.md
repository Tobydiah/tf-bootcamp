## Step 1 - Using codeblocks. 

Codeblocks in markdown make it **very easy** for *tech* people to copy, paste, share code. 
A good cloud engineer uses codeblocks whenever possible. 

Because it allows others to copy and paste their codes to replicate or research issues. 

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown, you need to use three backticks (`). 
- Not to be mistaken with single quotations or apostrophes.

```
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hi, I'm #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class
person1 = Person.new("John Doe", 30)

# Access and modify instance variables
person1.name = "Jane Smith"
person1.age = 35

# Call a method on the instance
person1.introduce

```

- When you can, you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks.


```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hi, I'm #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class
person1 = Person.new("John Doe", 30)

# Access and modify instance variables
person1.name = "Jane Smith"
person1.age = 35

# Call a method on the instance
person1.introduce

```

Good cloud engineers use codeblocks for both code and errors that appear in the console. 

```bash
def perform_calculation
  result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
  puts "Result of the calculation: #{result}"
end

def main
  puts "Starting calculation..."
  perform_calculation
  puts "Calculation complete."
end

main
```
> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.
